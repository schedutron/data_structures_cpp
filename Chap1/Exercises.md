1. *Think of a program you have used that is unacceptably slow. Identify the
specific operations that make the program slow. Identify other basic operations
that the program performs quickly enough.*

__A:__ I think of a CLI threaded newsreader I built in Python. It's slow in
organizing all the articles in a newsgroup into threads as it first downloads
all of their subjects and *then* organizes them. It can also get slow in
displaying specific articles as it has to download them first, and the speed of
that depends on the speed of the Internet connection. Operations which are
performed quick enough include formatting an article once it's downloaded and
writing a message to be sent to a local file before it's sent.

2. *Most programming languages have a built-in integer data type. Normally this
representation has a fixed size, thus placing a limit on how large a value can
be stored in an integer variable. Describe a representation for integers that
has no size restriction (other than the limits of the computerâ€™s available main
memory), and thus no practical limit on how large an integer can be stored.
Briefly show how your representation can be used to implement the operations
of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.*

__A__: A straightforward thing that came to my mind is, of course, *binary*
representation. But even representations which place a cap on the size of
integers to be stored use binary. However, I think of using binary differently.
In this representation, an integer is allocated memory dynamically. If during
some computation, the magnitude of the integer value increases and the existing
number of bits allocated to the integer are unable to store the new value (i.e.,
some sort of overflow occurs), then the computer should reallocate memory for
this integer so as to give it additional bits necessary to store it's value.
In a similar fashion, if the magnitude decreases, the integer can be reallocated
lesser memory to save space.
Addition and multiplication can be performed by the usual rules of binary
addition and multiplication, and exponentiation can be performed by repeated
multiplication.

3. *Define an ADT for character strings. Your ADT should consist of typical
functions that can be performed on strings, with each function defined in
terms of its input and output. Then define two different physical
representations for strings.*

__A__: Character strings are simply a sequence of characters. Strings are
an essential component of almost any computer program as they are the only
means of storing textual information in the program. Strings should support
the following functionalities:
  * concatenation: Given two strings, give back the joined form of the strings.
  For example, given "tea" and "pot", return "teapot".
  * find: Given a string and a character (or even a 'sub-string'), return the
  position of the character (or the substring), if present, within the string.
Following are two physical representation of strings:
  * Assign a byte value (or a block of multiple byte values) to every character
  and then store a string as an array of such byte values. Retrieval of the
  actual textual data from these byte values should be a straightforward task.
  * Can't think of other representation(s)!
